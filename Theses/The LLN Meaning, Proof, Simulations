Definition:

The Law of Large Numbers states that as the number of observations in a sample grows larger, the sample mean approaches the expected value (or population mean) of the underlying probability distribution. 

There are two versions of the Law of Large Numbers: 

    Weak Law of Large Numbers: In the weak version, the sample mean converges in probability to the population mean as the sample size increases. This means that, for any arbitrarily small positive epsilon (ε), the probability that the absolute difference between the sample mean and the population mean exceeds epsilon approaches zero as the sample size goes to infinity. 
    Strong Law of Large Numbers: The strong version states that the sample mean converges to the population mean as the sample size approaches infinity with probability = 1. 

The Weak Law of Large Numbers

The Weak Law of Large Numbers (WLLN) states that for a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables X1,X2,…,XnX1​,X2​,…,Xn​, with mean E(Xi​)=μ and finite variance Var(Xi​)=σ2, the sample mean Xˉn​ converges in probability to the population mean μ as n approaches infinity. 

Mathematically, the WLLN can be expressed as: limn→∞​P(∣ ∣​Xˉn​−μ∣ ∣​≥ϵ)=0 

Proof

The proof starts with Chebyshev's Inequality, which states that for any random variable Y with mean μY​ and variance σY2​, and for any a>0:

P(∣Y−μY∣≥a)≤σY2a2P(∣Y−μY​∣≥a)≤a2σY2​​ 

Apply Chebyshev's Inequality to the sample mean Xˉn:

P(∣Xˉn −μ∣∣​≥ϵ)≤ σ2nϵ2​

Then, take the limit as n approaches to infinity on both sides:

limn→∞​P(∣​Xˉn​−μ∣​≥ϵ)≤limn→∞​σ2nϵ2​ ​

As n goes to infinity, the right-hand side approaches zero.

Therefore, by the definition of convergence in probability, we obtain:

limn→∞​P(∣​Xˉn​−μ∣​≥ϵ)=0
 
The Strong Law of Large Numbers

The Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN) states that for a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables X1,X2,…,XnX1​,X2​,…,Xn​, with mean E(Xi​)=μ and finite variance Var(Xi​)=σ2, the sample mean Xˉn​ converges almost surely to the population mean μ as n approaches infinity. 

Mathematically, the SLLN can be expressed as: P(limn→∞​Xˉn​=μ)=1 

Proof 

Begin with Markov's Inequality, which states that for any non-negative random variable Y and any a>0:

P(Y≥a)≤E(Y)a​

Apply Markov's Inequality to the square of the absolute difference between the sample mean Xˉn​ and the population mean μ:

P((Xˉn−μ)2≥ϵ2)≤Var(Xˉn)ϵ2​

Since the random variables X1,X2,…,Xn​ are independent, the variance of the sample mean is given by σ2n​. Substitute this into the inequality:

P((Xˉn−μ)2≥ϵ2)≤σ2nϵ2​

Sum this inequality over all n:

∑n=1∞P((Xˉn−μ)2≥ϵ2)≤∑n=1∞σ2nϵ2​

The Borel-Cantelli Lemma states that if ∑n=1∞P(An)<∞, then P(lim sup⁡An)=0. Apply this lemma to the sum above:

P(lim sup⁡n→∞{(Xˉn−μ)2≥ϵ2})=0

To conclude, since the probability of the complement of lim sup⁡ is zero, we have:

P(lim⁡n→∞Xˉn=μ)=1

Simulation:

The simulation performed on part B of the third homework is related to the LLN because the frequency of the penetration is simulated for a large number of attacks.

In fact, the frequency of the penetration is a random variable dependent on the probability of penetration P.

The LLN states that as the number of attacks increases the frequency of the penetration will eventually converge to P.
