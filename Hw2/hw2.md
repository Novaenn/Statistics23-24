Homework 2

- Please, complete our survey (or add new variables), so we have data

1.
Choose 3 variables from our surveys:
- one Qualitative
- one Quantitative discrete
- one Quantitative continuous (use class intervals in this case, obviously)

create the most efficient algorithms to compute the frequency (absolute/relative/percentage) distribution of:

- the 3 variables
- the joint distribution of 2 variables (use a general logic, where variables could be any number).

Double check/compare the results using some DBMS functionalities you prefer (eg., access, oracle online, postgres, ...)


2.
For the following most important data structures (or others that you may want to suggest) find out how to:

-loop (break/continue)
-add/remove/get/set/check the existence of key/value

data structures:
array, list, dictionary, sorted list, hashset, sortedset, queue, stack, linkedlist

Note in a very concise way your finding in your Js Cheatsheet, and, in case a corresponding Js object does not exists, create a simple equivalent class with all necessary corresponding methods.

3.
Generate N uniform random variates in [0,1) and determine the distribution into class intervals [i/k, (i+1)/k), i = 0,..., k-1.
Play with N and k values and draw some conclusion on the "shape" of the distribution.

For Js, always use latest ECMAScript (use classes) and strict mode
